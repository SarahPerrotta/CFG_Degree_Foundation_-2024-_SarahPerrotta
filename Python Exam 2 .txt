Code Evaluation

1. def find_max(numbers):

    max_num = numbers[0]  # Initialise max_num with the first element
    for num in numbers:
        if num > max_num:  # Check if current number is greater than max_num
            max_num = num
    return max_num

# Convert the string "3, 7, 2, 9, 5" to a list of integers
numbers = [int(x) for x in "3, 7, 2, 9, 5".split(",")]

# Call the function to find the maximum number
maximum = find_max(numbers)

print("Maximum number is:", maximum)

- The unnecessary if num in numbers check is removed.
- The return statement is placed outside the loop to ensure all elements are considered before returning the maximum value.
- The code converts the string "3, 7, 2, 9, 5" into a list of integers using a list comprehension before calling the find_max function.

2. - implementing a docstring is good practice as it improves codes readability
- to prevent future errors when an empty list is passed through a function consider adding "none" to indicate absence
- a max function on python has the same use as a loop, this is good practice to add
